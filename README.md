# Rust MMU Guest Lecture

The slides for my MMU Guest Lecture on the rust programming language given on the 28th November 2025.

To start the slide show:

```sh
npm i
npm dev
# visit <http://localhost:3030>
```

If you aren't familiar with Slidev I would highly recommend it as a FOSS alternative to MS PowerPoint. Learn more about Slidev at the [documentation](https://sli.dev/).
